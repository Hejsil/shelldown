# Shelldown

Shelldown is a set of scripts that make your shell into a markup language. In fact, this README was generated with Shelldown! See `README.sh`.

Shelldown currently supports outputting html, markdown and to the terminal with ansi escapes. The output is determined by the `SD_LANG` environment variable.
